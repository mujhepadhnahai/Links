Implement a Java program to traverse a graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS) with 13.4 an adjacency list. Use ArrayDeque for efficient traversal. The program should include a methods to initialize the graph, add edges, display the adjacency list, and perform BFS. Finally, use the main method to construct the graph, invoke BFS, and display the traversal output.
